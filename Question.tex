\section{Question}
\subsection{Why 4?}
What is sacred about 4 such that solution worked? Can a similar construction done for any other $n$? Our first approach is to find a similar combination for n=5 such that either $\psigen$ or $\psieval$ is secure for corruption upto 3.
\subsection{Difficulties for 5}
In the beginning to satisfy the above constraints good number of random combinations were tried, but none of them satisfy the constraints.\\ %for example consider the following:\\
Then next approach is to abstract out the problem in a system of linear inequality.\\
Note that in the solution given in \cite{BITMPC} for 4-input function, for $\psigen$ parties were $P_2,P_3,P_4$, that can be viewed as $P_1$ with weight 0, $P_2,P_3,P_4$ with weight 1. Similarly, for $\psieval$ parties were $P_1, P_1, P_2,P_3,P_4$, which can be viewed as $P_1$ with weight 2 and $P_2,P_3,P_4$ with weight 1. Let $WtVecf_i$ is the weight of party $P_i$ for a protocol for the function $f(\gen/\eval$).\\
Now consider $p_i$ as a boolean variable such that the party $P_i$ is honest iff $p_i=1$. Therefore we can say a protocol ($\psigen/\psieval$) for a function ($\gen /\eval$) is secure if 
$$ \sum_{i\in[n]} WtVecf_i \times p_i > (\sum_{i\in[n]} WtVecf_i)/2$$.
Therefore the whole problem can be viewed as:
$$ \sum_{i\in[n]} WtVec\gen_i \times p_i > (\sum_{i\in[n]} WtVec\gen_i)/2$$ or
$$ \sum_{i\in[n]} WtVec\eval_i \times p_i > (\sum_{i\in[n]} WtVec\eval_i)/2$$
for all $(p_1,\ldots, p_n)$ such that number of zeros is $\leq n-2$.
Therefore in the above system of linear inequality there are $2n$ variables( $n$ for $WtVec\gen$ and $n$ for $WtVec\eval$) and $(\binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} +  \ldots + \binom{n}{n-2})$ many constraints as this is the total number of all possible binary strings of length $n$ with number of zeros $\leq n-2$.
As the number of variables is much smaller than the number of constraints, so it's very unlikely that the above system of linear inequality will have any solution.\\
If there is not any solution for this system of linear inequality then we can say that constructing a similar compiler for arbitrary n for any function is not possible.\\
To check this for $n=5$ we have implemented and the result is that there is no combination till weight for all parties are 4.
