\begin{abstract}
Best Possible Information-Theoretic Security for Multi-Party Computation ($\BITMPC$) was presented in \cite{BITMPC} which addressed the problem that what is the best possible notion of security that one can hope to achieve in the Information-Theoretic(IT) setting. A new notion of secuity namely Best-possible security is defined. In the paper a complier was presented for a function $f(\cdot)$ for which there is a Non-Interactive Multi-Party Computation ($\NIMPC$) \cite{NIMPC} protocol and there are secure MPC to generate the correlated randomness and secure MPC to emulate the evaluator of the $\NIMPC$.
